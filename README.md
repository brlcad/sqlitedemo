# sqlitedemo
Basic demonstration interacting with SQLite via Qt

A minimal build script with hard-coded paths is provided showing the gist for how to compile.  Others will need to adapt for their local build environment. 

Tested on Qt 5.13.5 (Homebrew) on Mac OS X 11.7

You are welcome to use the code in this demo for any purpose whatsoever.
